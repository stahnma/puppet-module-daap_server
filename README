# Readme file for mt-daapd module

daap_server - A DAAP server that exports your music collection via the Digital Audio Access Protocol as made famous by Apple iTunes.


This puppet module should basically do just a few things.

1.  Install mt-daapd
2.  Deliver a configuration file in /etc/mt-daapd.conf
3.  Enable the daemon for startup
4.  Startup the daemon




Also, you may need to open port 3689 (udp and tcp) in your firewall.  I haven't added that to this module yet.
